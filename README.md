# RandomTextPicker
## Simple C# Console app to randomly select an item from a list of items

I mostly made this to compete with a couple coworkers who had made their own randomizers for picking which restaurant to eat out at on a given day. Each had used a different language, so I made mine in C#.


## Build:

Navigate to ~/RandomTextPicker/RandomTextPicker in the console app of your choice

```
$ csc Program.cs
```

## Run:
### On PC

```
$ Program
```

### On Mac

You'll need [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) installed but otherwise it isn't much more complicated.

```
$ mono Program.exe
```
