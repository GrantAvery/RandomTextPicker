### Simple C# console app to randomly select an item from a list of items

I mostly made this to compete with a couple coworkers who had made their own randomizers for picking which restaurant to eat out at on a given day. Each had used a different language, so I made mine in C#.

You'll want to put your own items in the input.txt file, or remove the file and manually input them via console each time.

## Build:

Navigate to {baseRepo}/RandomTextPicker in the console app of your choice

```
$ csc Program.cs
```

## Run:
### On PC

```
$ Program
```

### On Mac

You'll need [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) installed but otherwise it isn't much more complicated.

```
$ mono Program.exe
```
